# DirectDemocracy-Through-49-O-Voter
This is repoistory to create apps that will automatically convert voters selecting 49-O NOTA option in Electronic Voting Machine(EVM) as Direct Democrats.These direct democrats profile will be linked to Indian National Voters Blockchain Core.Any financial decision or policy decision will implement only after voters Commit their vote taken in Parliment Sessions.

### The 49-O Voters
Till now old political system (Representational Democracy) the way things are going did not help reduce corruption or bring good governance even if honest politicians comes into power.We need to review the strategy and fight for making Direct Democracy in India reality. From my point of view to  reduce corruption we need to reduce power concentration in hands of few people. 

So far we have seen government tenders and contracts going only to shell companies formed by close associates of Political parties in power. The main reason why most people see public office as business where they can make money.This leads to favoritism, nepotism, brain drain, crony capitalism and leaving out talented people who can do job better.These talented people are going to foreign countries to contribute their talent for better opportunities.

We need introduce direct voting mechanism involve people to affect politics of the country.Example awarding the contracts for issues like laying ditches, roads also anything that involve MLA, MP, Ministers and long term finance of the country, introduction of voting directly by people should be made necessary.

This direct democracy should be experimented through 49-O voters.49-O Voters should be given power take decision in financial and policy through use of BlockChain, Crypto Non Fungible Tokens (NFT's),  web 3.0 and Generative AI technology combination.They should also be done through apps, SMS, AI voice calls, missed calls and government websites also voting machines, postal voting need to be used.

In hypothetical scenario with current state of 49-O re-election will go on infinity , instead of selecting someone to represent why not people should choose what they want in terms of policy and finance of country 

Strategy should be to bring  Direct Democracy to mainstream politics and in Representational democracy for people to vote in general election to be their representative only for constitutional amendments this change should be hybrid democracy for India's future.

# CryptoAnarchy
Crypto anarchism, cryptoanarchy and crypto-anarchism are three words that can mean a wide variety of different things.
Crypto-anarchism is a branch of anarchist philosophy that focuses on the use of technology to protect privacy as a means to assert autonomy from government and non-state actors interference with applications in communications, currency, commerce, and information security.

A crypto-anarchist is a person who consciously uses cryptographic methods for bringing about a more anarchist (meaning decentralized and decoupled form of political power) society. A crypto-anarchist may have one or more interests in cryptography, communications, computers, software, social causes, online rights, and the ability of technology to solve some of the problems humans face. #Artivism and Anonymous.

In general crypto-anarchists view government laws as a cynical expression of corporate influence yet the laws of mathematics that make modern cryptography possible is what describes our reality. We can proceed to exploit this difference in order to undermine corrupt authorities. Software that uses public key cryptography makes it very difficult for unintended persons to monitor what people say to each other. This provides a platform for freedom of expression and anonymity.

The first papers discussing the possibility of a crypto-anarchism were published by David Chaum in the 1980's and later by Tim May, people began thinking through the ramifications of new systems where the influence of state authorities wanes or no longer exists. Such systems can span anything from computer networks that do not rely on a centralized computer network like DNS servers (e.g., I2P), cryptography-based monetary systems that do not rely on authority for it to function (e.g., bitcoin), marketplaces for trade, and other services. All such decentralized and distributed systems rely on self-organization
