# CryptoAnarchy
Crypto anarchism, cryptoanarchy and crypto-anarchism are three words that can mean a wide variety of different things.
Crypto-anarchism is a branch of anarchist philosophy that focuses on the use of technology to protect privacy as a means to assert autonomy from government and non-state actors interference with applications in communications, currency, commerce, and information security.

A crypto-anarchist is a person who consciously uses cryptographic methods for bringing about a more anarchist (meaning decentralized and decoupled form of political power) society. A crypto-anarchist may have one or more interests in cryptography, communications, computers, software, social causes, online rights, and the ability of technology to solve some of the problems humans face. #Artivism and Anonymous.

In general crypto-anarchists view government laws as a cynical expression of corporate influence yet the laws of mathematics that make modern cryptography possible is what describes our reality. We can proceed to exploit this difference in order to undermine corrupt authorities. Software that uses public key cryptography makes it very difficult for unintended persons to monitor what people say to each other. This provides a platform for freedom of expression and anonymity.
