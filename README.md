# DirectDemocracy-Through-49-O-Voter
This is repoistory to create apps that will automatically convert voters selecting 49-O NOTA option in Electronic Voting Machine(EVM) as Direct Democrats.These direct democrats profile will be linked to Indian National Voters Blockchain.Any policy decision or financial decision will implement only after majority voters Commit their vote taken in Parliment Sessions.

# CryptoAnarchy
Crypto anarchism, cryptoanarchy and crypto-anarchism are three words that can mean a wide variety of different things.
Crypto-anarchism is a branch of anarchist philosophy that focuses on the use of technology to protect privacy as a means to assert autonomy from government and non-state actors interference with applications in communications, currency, commerce, and information security.

A crypto-anarchist is a person who consciously uses cryptographic methods for bringing about a more anarchist (meaning decentralized and decoupled form of political power) society. A crypto-anarchist may have one or more interests in cryptography, communications, computers, software, social causes, online rights, and the ability of technology to solve some of the problems humans face. #Artivism and Anonymous.

In general crypto-anarchists view government laws as a cynical expression of corporate influence yet the laws of mathematics that make modern cryptography possible is what describes our reality. We can proceed to exploit this difference in order to undermine corrupt authorities. Software that uses public key cryptography makes it very difficult for unintended persons to monitor what people say to each other. This provides a platform for freedom of expression and anonymity.

The first papers discussing the possibility of a crypto-anarchism were published by David Chaum in the 1980's and later by Tim May, people began thinking through the ramifications of new systems where the influence of state authorities wanes or no longer exists. Such systems can span anything from computer networks that do not rely on a centralized computer network like DNS servers (e.g., I2P), cryptography-based monetary systems that do not rely on any bank or authority for it to function (e.g., bitcoin), marketplaces for trade, and other services. All such decentralized and distributed systems rely on self-organization
